Archive a completed change in the experimental workflow.

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`, `schemas`, `view`). Once selected, treat `--store <id>` as sticky for the rest of the workflow. Every unscoped example of those commands below is shorthand: before running it, append the flag. For example, run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json --store "<id>"`, not the unscoped form shown below. Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Project check:** These steps expect a project that already uses OpenSpec. Before the first step that writes anything (`new change`, `archive`, `sync specs`, or authoring an artifact file), confirm the project has a root: run `openspec list --json` (with `--store <id>` when a store is selected, since the store is then the root) and read `root`. A root object means the project is set up. `"root": null` means it is not - there is no `openspec/` directory here, and a write such as `openspec new change` would create one as a side effect. The command also exits non-zero, which is that answer rather than a broken CLI, so read the JSON instead of retrying or working around it.

One `"root": null` is not about setup: when a `status` error message starts with `Declared in` or `Invalid store declaration in` and names this project's `openspec/config.yaml` (or `config.yml`), the project does use OpenSpec through a store it declares, which this machine cannot resolve (the store is not registered, or the `store:` line is malformed). Do not treat it as uninitialized and skip the branches below: stop before writing and show the user that error's `message` and `fix`.

Otherwise, with no root, what happens next depends on how this workflow was reached:

- **Auto-selected**: you chose this workflow yourself, without the user naming OpenSpec, naming this skill, or running its slash command. Stop using OpenSpec and answer the request normally, as you would with no OpenSpec installed. Do not ask them to set anything up and do not mention OpenSpec setup.
- **Explicit OpenSpec request**: the user named OpenSpec, named this skill, or ran its slash command. Stop before writing and ask how to proceed: set this project up (`openspec init`), target a store they already have (`--store <id>`), or continue without OpenSpec for this request. Wait for their answer.

In both branches, never create the root as a side effect: do not run `openspec init` until the user asks for it, do not hand-create `openspec/` files, and do not let a command create it.

**Delegation tiers**

Use three agent tiers. Pick the smallest tier that fits the unit of work.

- **Planner** — high-end model at high reasoning effort. Owns scope, architecture, dependency decomposition, acceptance criteria, semantic merge/conflict decisions, and final synthesis. Use for ambiguity, cross-cutting choices, and deciding *what* is true or in scope.
- **Coordinator** — advanced/intermediate model at medium reasoning effort. Owns the authoritative progress state, task ownership, dispatch, joining results, serialized updates to shared state, verification of returned work, and workflow transitions. Use for orchestrating work the planner has already decomposed.
- **Worker** — economical model at high reasoning effort (or its own default). Executes ONE bounded, fully specified unit: a lookup, a draft, an edit, or a check. **Workers never delegate**, never spawn agents, never select another workflow, never expand scope, and never make unresolved planning decisions. A worker returns blockers instead of guessing.

**Model calibration** — read `models.json` from the resolved OpenSpec root's `openspec/` directory first (the same `root.path` this workflow already resolved; when a store is selected the store root wins). Each tier contains a primary `{ model, effort, note? }` and may independently contain a `secondary: { model, effort, note? }`. When the file is absent, the advisory defaults below include both pairings; they remain advisory until the user confirms persistence. Existing project files without a secondary remain primary-only until the user configures one. Each pairing has its own effort; the model IDs in a tier's pair must differ. If a configured model is unavailable, report that fact.

**Fixed routing policy (only enforced by a verified native host)** — Each dispatch runs entirely on one admitted model using the host's own retry sequence; routing adds no retry budget or in-dispatch model switching. Persistent consistent availability failures move later dispatches to the configured secondary: consistent observations within a retried dispatch, or two consecutive un-retried failed dispatches. A single un-retried failure never moves the tier. The pairing then enters a 300-second cooldown so later dispatches use secondary; after expiry exactly one real dispatch probes primary recovery. Failed work is reported and never replayed or resubmitted. There is no tertiary or nearest-unconfigured substitute. Availability categories: authentication, credits/quota, unavailable model, transport, rate limit, overload, server failure. Task/tool failures, refusals, answer quality, invalid requests, context limits, cancellation, and unknown errors never move the tier.

**Activation truth** — Report `advisory` when the host cannot enforce the policy, `restart-required` when native assets were just installed or changed, and `native` only when a verified host contract enforces it. On-disk assets prove installation readiness only; they do not prove that a running host loaded or enforces them. Report runtime enforcement only when attested, and never fabricate runtime health. Advisory guidance does not promise automatic fallback or cooldown.

| Tier | Default primary | Effort | Default secondary | Effort | Verified effort ladders |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| planner | `openai/gpt-6.1-sol` | high | `deepinfra/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-V2.6-Pro` | high | OpenAI: low · medium · high · xhigh · **max**; MiMo ceiling is **high** (no max) |
| coordinator | `openai/gpt-6.1-sol` | medium | `deepinfra/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-V2.6-Pro` | high | OpenAI: low · medium · high · xhigh · **max**; MiMo ceiling is **high** (no max) |
| worker | `openai/gpt-6-luna` | max | `deepinfra/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-V2.6-Flash` | high | Luna: none · low · medium · high · xhigh · **max**; MiMo Flash ceiling is **high** |

Alternatives that fit the same tier, with their verified ceilings: **Claude Opus 5.5** (low→max), **Gemini 4 Argon** (low·medium·**high** — no max, so "high" is its top), **Claude Haiku 5.5** (low→max), **DeepSeek V4.1 Flash 1017** (none·low·high·**max** — no medium), **MiMo-V2.6-Flash** (same ceiling as MiMo-V2.6-Pro: **high** where an effort ladder exists). Never claim an effort the model's ladder does not list; when unsure, use `high` or the model's `default`.

**Handoffs**

Every delegated prompt must be self-contained. Workers do not see the conversation. Include: the tier and the unit's goal; absolute paths for the project root, the change root, the exact input files, and the exact output file(s); the relevant context, rules, and acceptance criteria; any files the unit owns or must NOT touch; how to verify completion; and an explicit stop condition. Say in one line what to return: a changed-path list, evidence, or a blocker.

**Parallelism**

- **Fan out** every independent unit concurrently. Independence means disjoint file ownership AND no data/state dependency on another in-flight unit.
- **Sequence** dependent units: finish the producer, hand its output to the next tier explicitly, then run the consumer. A dependency is a reason to await a previous agent — not a reason to collapse everything into one agent.
- Dispatch all independent workers in one wave, then **join every started worker** before touching shared state (task checkboxes, status output, spec files, archive moves). Never release dependent work from a partially completed wave.
- Cap concurrency to what the host can actually run in parallel; when in doubt, prefer a few large bounded units over many tiny ones.

**Synchronization rules**

- The coordinator owns all checkbox/status updates and shared tracking files. Workers return evidence; they do not edit tracking state.
- Serialize any two units that write the same file, the same capability's spec, or the same shared resource (services, ports, browser sessions, lockfiles, generated output).
- When a write target cannot be partitioned cleanly, delegate the *analysis* in parallel and serialize the *writes*.
- Never run background work across an archive move; every delegate must be joined before the move.
- A unit that cannot be completed as specified returns a blocker with what it found. Do not silently narrow, defer, or drop specified behavior.

**Parallel opportunity**: after scope is fixed, gather independent checks and per-capability assessments concurrently. Then serialize the mutations: warnings, user confirmation, any requested spec sync (fully joined, stop on failure), the structure/content check of every delta, and only then the move of the change directory. Nothing may still be running when the move happens.

`<capability-path>` is the spec directory relative to `specs/` (for example, `user-auth` or `identity/user-auth`). Preserve the full path from each delta spec when resolving its main spec.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **Select the change**

   If a name is provided, use it. Otherwise:
   - Infer from conversation context if the user mentioned a change
   - Auto-select if only one active change exists
   - If ambiguous, run `openspec list --json` to get available changes and ask the user to select one

   When prompting, show only active changes (not already archived).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.

   Always announce: "Using change: <name>" and how to override (e.g., `/openspec-archive-change <other>`).

   **Load current archive inputs before the existing archive checks:**

   After resolving the selected change and planning root, run:
   ```bash
   openspec instructions archive --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Keep the same selected-root flags on this command. This lookup is advisory and
   optional: it only supplies extra prompt inputs, so it must never block archiving.
   If it exits non-zero or returns invalid JSON — for example on an older CLI that
   does not support this command yet — continue the archive workflow with no
   context and no operation guidance. Do not report an error and do not stop.

   A successful response may omit both optional fields. Treat `context` as a
   required prompt-level input: read and consider it, and apply relevant project
   facts, conventions, and constraints. Treat `operationGuidance` as optional
   additive advice: read and consider every entry, and follow entries that are
   applicable and compatible with the built-in archive workflow.

   Keep both fields separate from built-in steps, explicit user choices, resolved
   paths, CLI checks, and command contracts. If context conflicts with one of those
   controlling inputs, report the conflict and preserve the controlling value. If
   guidance is inapplicable or conflicts with a controlling input, do not follow it
   and explain why. Do not infer replacement paths, skipped prompts, or flags from
   either field, and do not copy their text verbatim into specs, change artifacts,
   or archive summaries unless the user separately asks for it. These are
   prompt-level behavior contracts, not enforceable checks.

2. **Check artifact completion status**

   Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` to check artifact completion.

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`: path and scope context
   - `artifacts`: List of artifacts with their status (`done`, `skipped`, or other)

   **If any artifacts are neither `done` nor `skipped`** (skipped artifacts satisfy the requirement - the change declares skip_specs):
   - Display warning listing incomplete artifacts
   - Ask the user to confirm they want to proceed
   - Proceed if user confirms

3. **Check task completion status**

   Run `openspec list --json` with the same selected-root flags and find the
   entry in `changes` whose `name` exactly matches the selected change.
   Require exactly one match and nonnegative integer `totalTasks` and
   `completedTasks`, with `completedTasks <= totalTasks`. The CLI resolves
   the schema's tracked task files, including custom artifact names, output
   paths, and globs.
   Incomplete tasks = `totalTasks - completedTasks`.

   Do not infer task completion from artifact status or the absence of a
   top-level `tasks.md`. If the lookup fails, returns invalid JSON, omits or
   duplicates the selected change, or returns invalid counts, report the problem
   and stop before syncing or archiving.
   The CLI counts only `x`/`X` checkbox markers as complete;
   other markers, including unfamiliar ones, remain incomplete.

   **If incomplete tasks found:**
   - Display warning showing count of incomplete tasks
   - Ask the user to confirm they want to proceed
   - Proceed if user confirms

   **If `totalTasks` is zero:** Proceed without a task-related warning.

4. **Assess delta spec sync state**

   Use `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths` from status JSON as the only
   delta-spec source. If the `specs` entry is missing or
   `existingOutputPaths` is empty, proceed without a sync prompt and do not infer
   delta specs from other artifacts.

   **If delta specs exist:**
   - Compare each delta spec with its corresponding main spec at `<planningHome.root>/openspec/specs/<capability-path>/spec.md` (use the store-aware `planningHome.root` from step 2, not a hardcoded repo path)
   - A missing main spec is **not automatically** "already synced". For a new capability, the main spec is an *output* of the sync, not an input:
     - If the delta has MODIFIED or RENAMED requirements, report that only ADDED requirements can create a new main spec and mark that capability as sync-blocked. Never invent a requirement that has no current version.
     - Otherwise, if the delta has only REMOVED requirements and the change's `.openspec.yaml` declares `retire_capabilities: true`, the capability is already retired: count it as already synced, warn that there is nothing left to remove, and do not recreate the main spec. Apply this rule both now and when verifying a completed sync.
     - Otherwise, if the delta has no ADDED requirements, report that no sync is possible and mark that capability as sync-blocked. For a REMOVED-only delta, warn that there is no main spec to remove from and leave the main-spec tree unchanged. `openspec archive` refuses the unmarked REMOVED-only case with `Spec must have at least one requirement`.
     - Otherwise, count the capability as needing sync and name it in the summary (`<capability-path>: new main spec will be created`). If the delta also has REMOVED requirements, warn that they will be ignored because there is no main spec to remove from. The sync creates the main spec from only the delta's ADDED requirements, exactly as `openspec archive` does.
   - Determine what changes would be applied (adds, modifications, removals, renames)
   - Continue assessing the remaining capabilities even when one is sync-blocked. Show a combined summary before prompting.

   **Prompt options:**
   - If any capability is sync-blocked: explain why and offer only "Archive without syncing", "Cancel"
   - Otherwise, if changes needed: "Sync now (recommended)", "Archive without syncing"
   - Otherwise, if already synced: "Archive now", "Sync anyway", "Cancel"

   Route on the answer:
   - "Cancel" — stop, do not archive
   - "Archive without syncing" or "Archive now" — proceed to archive
   - "Sync now" or "Sync anyway" — sync, then verify (below). Do not start any sync while a capability is sync-blocked; explain the blocker and repeat the available choices.
   - Anything else — ask again rather than archiving

   Before a selected sync writes any main spec, run
   `openspec instructions specs --change "<name>" --json` once with the same
   selected-root flags. Require a zero exit status and valid artifact-instruction
   JSON. If the lookup fails or returns invalid JSON, report the error and stop
   before writing any main spec or moving the change. A valid response with omitted
   `rules` is the no-rules case. Apply returned `rules` only to the content and
   form of main specs produced by this merge; do not use them as archive guidance,
   change CLI behavior, or copy the rule text into any output file.

   Then run the `openspec-sync-specs` workflow inline (agent-driven intelligent merge) for change '<name>', passing the delta spec analysis and the fetched specs-rule snapshot from above, and wait for it to finish. The inline sync must reuse that snapshot without fetching `specs` instructions again. Do not delegate it to a background task — step 5 would move `changeRoot` out from under a sync that is still reading it, leaving the change archived and the main specs never updated. If your agent can only run it by delegation, delegate synchronously and wait for the result.

   If the sync reports any stop or blocking condition, treat the sync as failed.
   Stop the archive immediately. Do not perform the post-sync content comparison and do not move its `changeRoot`.
   Nothing has moved, so the user can fix the blocking condition or re-run the sync.

   After the sync writes each main spec, verify its structure against the canonical sync contract:
   - A new main spec starts with a `# <capability> Specification` title. An existing main spec keeps its title exactly as it is.
   - Preserve existing `## Purpose` sections completely untouched for established main specs.
   - For a new main spec, copy the delta `## Purpose` verbatim. Warn only if the purpose text is shorter than standard validation expects. Do not regenerate or rewrite existing authored purpose. If no usable `## Purpose` is provided, use the existing TBD Purpose behavior and warning.
   - Verify that no delta-style section headers (`## ADDED Requirements`, `## MODIFIED Requirements`, `## REMOVED Requirements`, `## RENAMED Requirements`) remain in the main spec, adhering strictly to the sync workflow formatting rules.
   - Requirement blocks the sync wrote or changed use `### Requirement:` headings, and their scenarios use `#### Scenario:` headings, under the spec's `## Requirements` section. Leave content the delta does not mention exactly as it is.

   Then re-run the comparison from the top of this step, including the explicitly retired, missing-spec case, against every capability that has a delta spec in `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths` — not only the ones the sync reports it touched. A successful sync leaves nothing left to apply, so each capability must now read as already synced:
   - ADDED requirements present
   - MODIFIED requirements carrying the scenario and description changes named in the delta, with their other scenarios intact
   - REMOVED requirements gone — and where this sync retired a capability (removed its last requirement, leaving `## Requirements` empty), its main spec deleted rather than left empty.
   - RENAMED requirements present under the new name and absent under the old one

   If the sync failed, or any capability does not match, report what differs and stop — do not archive. Nothing has moved and `changeRoot` is intact, so the user can fix the mismatch or re-run the sync and start the archive again.

5. **Perform the archive**

   Create an `archive` directory under `planningHome.changesDir` if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive"
   ```

   Generate the target name: use the change name as-is when it already starts with a `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix; otherwise prepend the current date as `YYYY-MM-DD-<change-name>`. Never stack a second date (same rule as `openspec archive`).

   **Check if target already exists:**
   - If yes: Fail with error, suggest renaming existing archive or using different date
   - If no: Move `changeRoot` to the archive directory

   ```bash
   mv "<changeRoot>" "<planningHome.changesDir>/archive/<target-name>"
   ```

6. **Display summary**

   Show archive completion summary including:
   - Change name
   - Schema that was used
   - Archive location
   - Whether specs were synced (if applicable)
   - Note about any warnings (incomplete artifacts/tasks)

**Output On Success**

```markdown
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** the archive path derived from `planningHome.changesDir`/<target-name>/
**Specs:** <"✓ Synced to main specs" only if the step 4 verification passed; otherwise "No delta specs" or "Sync skipped">

<"All artifacts complete. All tasks complete." — or, if archived with warnings, list them instead (e.g. "Archived with 2 incomplete tasks")>
```

**Guardrails**
- Announce the selected change; prompt for selection when it is ambiguous
- Use artifact graph (openspec status --json) for completion checking
- Don't block archive on warnings - just inform and confirm
- Preserve .openspec.yaml when moving to archive (it moves with the directory)
- Show clear summary of what happened
- If sync is requested, run the `openspec-sync-specs` workflow inline (agent-driven)
- Never archive while a spec sync is still in flight — run the sync inline and verify the main specs before moving `changeRoot`
- If delta specs exist, always run the sync assessment and show the combined summary before prompting
- Apply relevant runtime context and report conflicts; operation guidance remains advisory
- Consider every guidance entry and explain any inapplicable or conflicting advice
- Existing CLI checks, resolved paths, prompts, and command contracts are unchanged
- Artifact rules constrain only the specs being written and are never operation guidance
- Never copy runtime context, operation guidance, or artifact-rule text verbatim into output files
